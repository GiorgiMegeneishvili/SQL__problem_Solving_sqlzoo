# SQL Problem Solving – SQLZoo Solutions

Welcome to my repo for practicing SQL problem-solving on [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/).

This repository contains my personal solutions to exercises and tutorials on SQLZoo.  
It's part of my continuous learning and practicing of SQL concepts.

## 📑 Structure

- Each `.sql` file contains solutions to specific problems from SQLZoo tutorials.
- File naming follows the pattern:
- Open `.sql` files to review solutions.
- Try running them on your SQL database to test and modify.

## 🎯 Goals

✅ Practice real SQL problems  
✅ Document my learning journey  
✅ Improve and version my solutions over time

## 💡 Next Steps

- Add more tutorials from SQLZoo
- Refactor file naming for consistency
- Add comments and explanations to queries
- Explore different SQL dialects (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
